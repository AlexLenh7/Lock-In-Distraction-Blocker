Lock In is a powerful and easy to use Chrome extension designed to help you stay focused by tracking and limiting time spent on problematic websites. Monitor your productivity, set daily limits, and build better browsing habits.

Download here:

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Enable and Add**
   - Click the extension icon and ensure the toggle is ON. Use the "Quick Add" button when visiting a distracting site, or manually type domains (e.g., youtube.com) in the Websites tab.

2. **Set Limits**
   - Go to Settings, under Time Limit make sure it says enabled, and set your daily max time. This limit applies specifically to the websites in your block list.

3. **Choose Action**
   Select what happens when time runs out:
   - **_Redirect_** to a site of your choosing
   - **_Block_** access completely with optional disable
     > _Optional: Instant Purge where tabs get instantly deleted_
   - **_Warn_** with a reminder in the top right corner

4. **Analyze**
   - Periodically check the Dashboard to see your weekly usage. Insights can be viewed with the button "Learn more about your habits". Note that sites under 1 minute are hidden but are still counted.

## 🛠 Features

### 📊 Dashboard & Insights

View your daily usage at a glance. The **Dashboard** shows real-time tracking for the current day and a 7-day history. **Insights** provides a "Lock In Score" determined by various data and compares your productivity trends against previous days.

### 🚫 Website Management

Easily manage your blocklist. The extension tracks time on all sites but only enforces restrictions on domains you specifically add.

>

### ⚙️ Settings & Block Modes

Customize how you stay focused:

- **Timer:** Set a global daily limit for all blocked sites.
- **AFK Detection:** Automatically pauses tracking after 5 minutes of inactivity.
- **Action Modes:** Choose between **Redirect** (send to a chosen site), **Block** (full-screen overlay blocking content), or **Warn** (unobtrusive reminder).

## 🔒 Privacy

> [!NOTE]
> Your data never leaves your device. Lock In does not use external servers, analytics, or data collection. All browsing history and settings are stored locally in your browser's storage.

## ❓ FAQ

**Why is the site I added not being blocked?**

> Ensure the toggle is ON near the top of the extension, the Timer is set to Active in settings, and you have reloaded the tab after adding the site. Also check that you haven't dismissed a previous warning for that tab.

**Why isn't a website being tracked?**

> There are certain websites that won't be tracked such as internal pages like chrome://, New Tab, and local files file://. These cannot be tracked or blocked.

**Does the extension track websites when minimized?**

> Yes, if the window is minimized / out of focus, the last website you were on will continue to be tracked until the AFK/Idle detection kicks in.

**Does the extension track tabs on a different monitor?**

> No unless you are specifically interacting with that tab, the extension won't track any tab that isn't being focused. This can include things such as youtube videos playing on a second monitor.

**Is my data private?**

> Yes, all data is stored locally in your Chrome browser's storage. Nothing is sent to external servers, and nothing is being tracked.

> [!TIP]
> If you have an issue that isn't listed always try reloading the extension by going to **Manage Extensions** and clicking the reload icon.
